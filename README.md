# Circuit Simulator

## Overview
Circuit Simulator is an advanced tool designed to simplify circuit analysis by enabling users to build and solve circuits through an intuitive graphical interface. The simulator supports fully customizable designs with an improved user experience, robust calculations, and powerful features. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Math.js**, it provides both a graphical view and a netlist representation to configure and analyze circuits of various complexities.
