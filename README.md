# Circuit Simulator

## Overview
Circuit Simulator is a tool designed to simplify circuit analysis by allowing users to build and solve circuits through an intuitive graphical interface. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Math.js**, this simulator provides both a graphical view and a netlist representation to help users configure and analyze a range of circuit elements.

## Features (Version 1.0)
The current version supports:

- **Component Interaction**: Users can add, edit, and delete fundamental circuit elements, including resistors and independent voltage/current sources.
- **Series and Parallel Configurations**: Flexible arrangement of components in series or parallel, enabling custom circuit designs.
- **Detailed Calculations**: Utilizes Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) to calculate voltage, current, and power for each component, with real-time data displayed in the GUI.
- **Interactive Hover Data**: Shows key data (e.g., voltage, current, power) on each component via a floating data panel, providing quick access to circuit parameters.
- **Unit Management**: Supports unit selection and conversion for component values, ensuring clarity and precision.

## Planned Updates
Future updates aim to add:

- **New Components**: Dependent sources, inductors, and capacitors to expand circuit-solving capabilities, including AC analysis.
- **Enhanced User Interaction**: A drag-and-drop feature for more convenient component placement and circuit organization.
